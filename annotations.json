However, there are also testimonies, according to which the fire, after relatively small bomb damage, had been laid by the Gestapo for the purpose of wiping tracks. The movie 'Der dritte Mann' which was filmed in 1948 in Vienna shows in a scene the ghostly ruin of Gestapo headquarters. The ruins were demolished after 1948.","text-source":"https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Hotel_M%C3%A9tropole","added-by":"Asil Cetin"},{"id":4,"title":"Burgtheater","coordinates":[48.2103,16.36157],"damage":3,"current-status":"Repaired","image":"https:\/\/www.wienerzeitung.at\/_em_daten\/173892\/_\/1x6C6mNvhD5UXMunvHO6oDeXreHKxInwQ2hiOhsYl5-jrLj19Mzj3rlKFbhveYsXac0hy9mD6XPoyTrtuDGyNsjZ-wVgstSU_TJFnNm2ZYuF0\/150429-1756-948-0960-179805.jpg","image-source":"https:\/\/www.wienerzeitung.at\/nachrichten\/kultur\/buehne\/749363_Das-Burgtheater-ist-eine-Idee.html","text":"In the summer of 1944, the Burgtheater had to be closed because of the ordered general theater ban.

The former Habsburg palace was at its reopening in 1952 as 'Graphic Art Collection Albertina' an austere and architecturally unattractive building and was deprived of its historic identity . For decades, the Albertina was only open to the public for a few hours a day (around 1936: 27 hours per week, 1959: 35 hours per week) and recorded low visitor numbers. Their scientific leaders placed much more value on their study character than on the impact of the collection on the general public. From 1962 to 1986 Walter Koschatzky acted as director and organized over 200 exhibitions and published numerous art historical works on the graphic arts. In his era, the Albertina was publicly perceived stronger again.","text-source":"https:\/\/de.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Albertina_(Wien)#Die_Albertina_im_Zweiten_Weltkrieg_und_danach","added-by":"Asil Cetin"}]}
