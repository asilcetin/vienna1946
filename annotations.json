Hundreds of people who sought shelter in the cellars were killed. At this location the 'Memorial against War and Fascism' was erected by the city of Vienna on the initiative of Mayor Helmut Zilk in 1988.",

      "text":"The State Opera of Vienna was struck by five explosive and numerous incendiary bombs. The stage house was destroyed, the auditorium and the side staircases were on fire. The fire raged two days and nights in the opera and the roofs collapsed. Except for the front, the State Opera was turned into a ruin. Until the re-opening of the State Opera a decade passed and for the ceremonial re-opening Ludwig van Beethoven's opera 'Fidelio' was performed on 5 November 1955 under conductor Karl Böhm.",

On March 12, 1945, the former Hotel Métropole burned down during the heavy air attack on Vienna and it was heavily damaged. However, there are also testimonies, according to which the fire, after relatively small bomb damage, had been laid by the Gestapo for the purpose of wiping tracks. The movie 'Der dritte Mann' which was filmed in 1948 in Vienna shows in a scene the ghostly ruin of Gestapo headquarters. The ruins were demolished after 1948.",

In a bomb attack, the house was damaged on the ring and burnt down on April 12, 1945 completely. Auditorium and stage were unusable, only the steel structure was preserved. The ceiling paintings and parts of the foyer were almost undamaged.",
